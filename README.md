Hii
===

A wrapper to use ii with much more comfort
These software is currently unstable, that mean I am experimenting with the
code and it could be possible the hii script generates some failure messages
or simply does not work.

Besides ii, I am using:

Dependencies:
-------------
* ii
* multitail
* pass

Here are some more or less implemented command-line options:

Options:
--------
* **-d | --dir** -- Change the directory for the configuration files
* **-c | --channel** -- Set the IRC-Channel you want to join to
* **-n | --nickname** -- Set your nickname
* **-r | --realname** -- Set your realname
* **-s | --server** -- Set the server you want to join to
* **-h | --help** -- Show this help
